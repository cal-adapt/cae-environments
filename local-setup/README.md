# Setting up climakitae computational environment on your local machine 

## Docker 
We have included a Makefile for your convenience that faciliates setting up a computational environment using Docker from which you can run climakitae. You'll need Docker installed on your machine. See the [Docker website](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) for more instructions. 

### How to use a Makefile 
From your terminal, from the directory containing the Makefile: 
```
make local 
```
